# Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) and Its Metadata

## Guidelines for the Assignment: 
The DLME Metadata Assignment is an assignment in one step. It builds upon the work we did in class on February 7th. 
This assignment can be done alone or in pairs (either the ones from class or new ones).  
This exercise has two main elements: (1) illustrating how federated libraries can help us understand different kinds of relationships between objects found in global collections and (2) exploring the [discoverability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability) of the items given their metadata.

## Identify two or three items from the [Digital Library of the Middle East]
Since I'm interested in sea shells(mainly bc of their beautiful rainbow shade reflected under sunshine), I set out searching "shell". Then I found an item called "Tridacna shell". 

![Tridacna shell](https://github.com/rosanna-del-este/rosanna-del-este.github.io/blob/8bc5cfff13fa3a89cf8a0364496eefc228e1c38f/images/Tridacna%20shell.jpg "Tridacna shell")
<div align="center"> Tridacna shell 3.33 x 4.29 in. (8.46 x 10.9 cm).” DLME, https://dlmenetwork.org/library/catalog/met_326244. </div>

Then I went on searching "Tridacna" in the metadata website, and found two other items that are shells, but are quite different. 

![Shell with winged female deity](https://github.com/rosanna-del-este/rosanna-del-este.github.io/blob/758b6f3344be5ea68f95652e977e53b44dba0da3/images/Shell%20with%20winged%20female%20deity.jpg "Shell with winged female deity")
<div align="center"> Shell engraved with winged female deity, sphinxes, and lotus plants 2 3/4 x 1 1/2 in. (7 x 3.8 cm)” DLME, https://dlmenetwork.org/library/catalog/met_327548. </div>

![shell with a sculpted female head](https://github.com/rosanna-del-este/rosanna-del-este.github.io/blob/758b6f3344be5ea68f95652e977e53b44dba0da3/images/shell%20with%20a%20sculpted%20female%20head.jpg "shell with a sculpted female head")
<div align="center"> Fragment of a shell with a sculpted female head 2 x 3 1/8 in. (5.1 x 7.9 cm).” DLME, https://dlmenetwork.org/library/catalog/met_324429. </div>

## Why should I use a static website?


## How is this template different?
