# Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) and Its Metadata

## Guidelines for the Assignment: 
The DLME Metadata Assignment is an assignment in one step. It builds upon the work we did in class on February 7th. 
This assignment can be done alone or in pairs (either the ones from class or new ones).  
This exercise has two main elements: (1) illustrating how federated libraries can help us understand different kinds of relationships between objects found in global collections and (2) exploring the [discoverability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability) of the items given their metadata.

## Identify two or three items from the [Digital Library of the Middle East]
Since I'm interested in sea shells(mainly bc of their beautiful rainbow shade reflected under sunshine), I set out searching "shell". Then I found an item called "Tridacna shell".

## Why should I use a static website?
A static website, simply put, is easier to manage than just about any other option out there for a simple website. Since it does not rely on any additional web application, it can be hosted on any webhosting server. It does not require regular updates like many dynamic websites such as WordPress or Drupal require. Everything that the website needs to work is contained within one directory, making it incredibly easy to move.

## How is this template different?
This template has been optimized for ease of use. In the next set of instructions you will see that there are less than five files that you need to edit in order to customize the look of the website.
