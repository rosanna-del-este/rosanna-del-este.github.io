# Working with a corpus

## pick your corpus and 
The Corpus Assignment, otherwise known as Assignment 2, will be completed in one step. It builds on work we did in the textual portion of the class, particularly with Voyant Tools and R Markdown files in Posit Cloud. This assignment can be done alone or in pairs.

## Pick a corpus. 
I decided to pick the corpus of [writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]. I'm especially interested in his work "the Adventure of Sherlock Holmes". I saw that there are different version of the release of this book, so I was wondering if I could do a textual analysis of the different issues and compare them.

## Introduction to Arthur Conan Doyle, and his fictional characteer Sherlock Holmes
Conan Doyle had a multifaceted career as a writer, journalist, and public figure, despite being most renowned as the creator of Sherlock Holmes. He was born in 1859 in Edinburgh and received a medical degree from Edinburgh University in 1881. He worked as a surgeon on a whaling ship and a medical officer on a steamer before settling in Portsmouth, where he split his time between writing and medicine.
Sherlock Holmes first appeared in "A Study of Scarlet" in 1887, which was successful enough to motivate Conan Doyle to write more stories. However, he killed off Holmes in 1893 to focus on more serious writing, causing a public uproar that led him to bring the detective back to life. Conan Doyle also authored other novels, such as "The Lost World," and non-fiction works, including a pamphlet justifying Britain's involvement in the Boer War, for which he received a knighthood. He also wrote histories of World War One, in which his family members perished, and ran unsuccessfully for parliament twice. In his later years, he became deeply interested in spiritualism before passing away from a heart attack on July 7, 1930.
